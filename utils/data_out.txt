<start> oh, scary place. <end>
<start> morty: wow, rick! <end>
<start> that's -that's one -one heck of a story. <end>
<start> i sure do wish i could have been there to see it happen. <end>
<start> rick: oh, come on. <end>
<start> who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at shoney's? <end>
<start> beth: dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home? <end>
<start> rick: emotionally speaking, honey, shoney's is my home. <end>
<start> jerry: yeah, but you just got out of prison. <end>
<start> i mean, how much of a step up from that is -- <end>
<start> rick: jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times. <end>
<start> jerry: you got it. <end>
<start> [ grunting ] <end>
<start> rick: six folds, huh? <end>
<start> w-w-what, have you guys got me in a series 9000? <end>
<start> you cheap insect [bleep] didn't think i was worth your best equipment? <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: [ chuckles ] man, i told the money bugs. <end>
<start> i said, "you know who this guy is, right? <end>
<start> you want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer. <end>
<start> rick: well, you might as well order some pancakes, because i don't see the need to leave this part of my brain. <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: oh, i think you do. <end>
<start> eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum. <end>
<start> rick: shoney's. <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: or the series 9000 is going to turn it into mush. <end>
<start> [ farts ] <end>

<start> i just got my sixth promotion this week, and i still don't know what i do. <end>
<start> summer: who cares how high they promote you? <end>
<start> everyone just gets paid in pills. <end>
<start> jerry: well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules. <end>
<start> beth: summer, show your father some respect. <end>
<start> he's pulling down a six-chewable figure income. <end>
<start> [ bottle shatters ] <end>
<start> conroy: i'll get that in a moment. <end>
<start> how are everyone's pills? <end>
<start> oh, morty, you've hardly touched your pills. <end>
<start> morty: i kind of had big pills for lunch, and i [muffled] wasn't gonna eat any more pills. <end>
<start> [ gulps ] thank you, conroy. <end>
<start> jerry: you spoil us, conroy. <end>
<start> summer: [slams hands on table] grandpa rick wouldn't put up with this! <end>
<start> beth: [bangs fist on table] stop saying his name! <end>
<start> he abandoned us. <end>
<start> jerry: [bangs fist on table] willem dafoe! <end>
<start> th-that's the guy i couldn't think of this morning. <end>
<start> beth: don't make my mistake, summer. <end>
<start> don't deify the people that leave you. <end>
<start> you'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses [ sobs ] healthy forever. <end>
<start> [ sniffles ] horses live longer than tortoises now. <end>
<start> is that what you want for yourself? <end>
<start> summer: maybe i just want you to care if i run away yelling! <end>

<start> so safe, so comfortable, so shoney's. <end>
<start> but admit it, rick -you're going crazy cooped up in here. <end>
<start> let's go visit some memories. <end>
<start> rick: oh, any particular ones? <end>
<start> you want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment i discovered interdimensional travel? <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: [ squeals ] <end>
<start> rick:' ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. <end>
<start> does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape? <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: it's arousal. <end>
<start> yes, i'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun. <end>
<start> rick: yeah, well, tough titties. <end>
<start> [ rumbling ] <end>
<start> convelious daniel: there's no tougher titty than a psychotic break, rick. <end>
<start> rick: well, that depends on who breaks first -me or the titty. <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: someone special you remember? <end>
<start> is that your memory of her out there -between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper? <end>
<start> [ whooshing ] <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: if we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. <end>
<start> if you take me where i want to go she'll be there, too, won't she? <end>
<start> rick: the day i invented the portal gun is the day i lost her. <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: oh, that sounds cool. <end>
<start> i can get what i want and you can say goodbye. <end>
<start> rick: [ sighs ] fine, but i'm driving. <end>
<start> 9/11 memory rick: --as an excuse to strip away our freedom! <end>
<start> transition to the garage <end>
<start> morty: huh? <end>
<start> what are you -what are you doing? <end>
<start> summer: grandpa rick must have some secret lab, right? <end>
<start> with, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! <end>
<start> and we can go break him out of prison! <end>
<start> look at these dead flies! <end>
<start> maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door. <end>
<start> morty: summer, you're freaking me out. <end>
<start> i know things have changed a lot, and i know you miss rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. <end>
<start> and, you know, we're not doing so bad. <end>
<start> summer: we're miserable, morty! <end>
<start> there's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the eiffel tower! <end>
<start> morty: hey, i like being 35. <end>
<start> i-i can rent a car now. <end>
<start> summer: because you suck! <end>
<start> you've been keeping your lip zipped about it since grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him. <end>
<start> morty: he bails on everybody! <end>
<start> he bailed on mom when she was a kid! <end>
<start> he -he bailed on tiny planet! <end>
<start> and in case i never made this clear to you, summer, he bailed on you. <end>
<start> he left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! <end>
<start> because nobody's special to him, summer, not even himself. <end>
<start> so, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. <end>
<start> the one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! <end>
<start> summer: you're right! <end>
<start> morty: what?! <end>
<start> no, i'm not right. <end>
<start> i-i was using ghoulish overkill! <end>

<start> the moment that changed everything. <end>
<start> mcdonald's drive-thru speaker: welcome to mcdonald's. <end>
<start> can i take your order? <end>
<start> rick: yeah, i'd like to get a 10-piece mcnugget and a bunch of the szechuan sauce. <end>
<start> like, as much as you're allowed to give me. <end>
<start> in 1998, they had this promotion for the disney film "mulan," where they -where they -they created a new sauce for the mcnuggets called szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! <end>
<start> and then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. <end>
<start> this is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory. <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting. <end>
<start> rick: okay. <end>
<start> all right, all right. <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: is that-- <end>
<start> rick: me. <end>
<start> i used to wear blue pants. <end>
<start> [ zapping ] <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel: when'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel? <end>
<start> rick: i didn't. <end>
<start> i did. <end>
<start> [ whooshing ] <end>
<start> alternate rick: well, well, well. <end>
<start> if it isn't us. <end>
<start> you know the worst part about inventing teleportation? <end>
<start> suddenly, you're able to travel the whole galaxy, and the first thing you learn is, you're the last guy to invent teleportation. <end>
<start> fortunately, you're about to invent something much more powerful. <end>

<start> [ thunder crashes ] <end>

<start> summer: fine, stay here. <end>
<start> i'll rescue grandpa myself. <end>
<start> morty: and how are you gonna do that? <end>
<start> summer: i don't know yet. <end>
<start> i'll make it up as i go. <end>
<start> that's what grandpa rick does. <end>
<start> that's what heroes do. <end>

<start> dude, you have yourself -your infinite selves. <end>

<start> did you make a breakthrough? <end>
<start> young rick: sort of. <end>

<start> all right, it's been great, guys. <end>
<start> i really only wanted to stop by here for a quick "i told ya so." so, uh-- <end>

<start> can you hear me? <end>

<start> we have infinite grandkids. <end>
<start> you're trying to use disney bucks at a caesar's palace here. <end>
<start> summer: that's a bluff. <end>
<start> he's bluffing, sir. <end>
<start> he loves me. <end>
<start> riq iv: you're a rogue rick -irrational, passionate. <end>
<start> you love your grandkids. <end>
<start> you came to rescue them. <end>

<start> he's not bluffing. <end>
<start> he's not bluffing! <end>
<start> morty: r-rick? <end>
<start> riq iv: why not shoot through her? <end>
<start> rick: 20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, my first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. <end>
<start> the risk to me is minimized if i wait for you to shoot her, which i'm encouraging you to do. <end>
<start> summer: what the [bleep] <end>
<start> rick: or let her go, which i will reward with a quicker death. <end>
<start> riq iv: because you love her! <end>
<start> rick: because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. <end>
<start> but if you want to die slower than that, i'm super into it. <end>
<start> all you got to do to get that started is kill the girl. <end>
<start> summer: i hate you! <end>
<start> rick: not an issue, sweetie. <end>
<start> morty: that's enough! <end>
<start> drop the gun, rick! <end>
<start> rick: morty, i know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really [bleep] this up right now. <end>
<start> morty: i'm not letting you let my sister die! <end>
<start> drop the gun! <end>
<start> rick: i wasn't gonna let her die, you [bleep] moron! <end>
<start> riq iv: ha! <end>
<start> summer: aww. <end>
<start> rick: the point is he thought i was going to. <end>

<start> gromflomite guard: freeze! <end>
<start> rick: employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen. <end>
<start> morty: so, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways? <end>
<start> rick: destroying the [burps] galactic government. <end>
<start> morty and summer: awesome! <end>
<start> whoa, cool! <end>
<start> summer: are you going to set all their nukes to target each other? <end>
<start> morty: ooh, or -or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet? <end>

<start> let's go visit some memories. <end>
<start> Rick: oh, any particular ones? <end>
<start> you want to See my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment i discovered interdimensional travel? <end>
<start> cornvelious Daniel: [ squeals ] <end>
<start> Rick:' ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. <end>
<start> does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape? <end>
<start> cornvelious Daniel: it's arousal. <end>
<start> yes, i'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun. <end>
<start> Rick: yeah, well, tough titties. <end>
<start> [ rumbling ] <end>
<start> convelious Daniel: there's no tougher titty than a psychotic break, Rick. <end>
<start> Rick: well, that depends on who breaks first -me or the titty. <end>
<start> cornvelious Daniel: someone special you remember? <end>
<start> is that your memory of her out there -between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper? <end>
<start> [ whooshing ] <end>

<start> if you take me where i want to go she'll be there, too, won't she? <end>
<start> Rick: the day i invented the portal gun is the day i lost her. <end>
<start> cornvelious Daniel: oh, that sounds cool. <end>
<start> i can get what i want and you can Say goodbye. <end>

<start> summer: grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? <end>
<start> with, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! <end>
<start> and we can go break him out of prison! <end>
<start> look at these dead flies! <end>
<start> maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door. <end>
<start> Morty: summer, you're freaking me out. <end>
<start> i know things have changed a lot, and i know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. <end>
<start> and, you know, we're not doing so bad. <end>
<start> summer: we're miserable, Morty! <end>
<start> there's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the eiffel tower! <end>
<start> Morty: hey, i like being 35. <end>
<start> i-i can rent a car now. <end>
<start> summer: because you suck! <end>
<start> you've been keeping your lip zipped about it since grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him. <end>
<start> Morty: he bails on everybody! <end>
<start> he bailed on mom when she was a kid! <end>
<start> he -he bailed on tiny planet! <end>
<start> and in Case i never made this clear to you, summer, he bailed on you. <end>
<start> he left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! <end>
<start> because nobody's special to him, summer, not even himself. <end>
<start> so, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. <end>
<start> the one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! <end>
<start> summer: you're right! <end>
<start> Morty: what?! <end>

<start> can i take your order? <end>
<start> Rick: yeah, i'd like to get a 10-piece mcnugget and a bunch of the szechuan sauce. <end>
<start> like, as much as you're allowed to give me. <end>
<start> in 1998, they had this promotion for the disney film "mulan," where they -where they -they created a new sauce for the mcnuggets called szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! <end>
<start> and then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. <end>
<start> this is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory. <end>

<start> summer: fine, stay here. <end>
<start> i'll rescue grandpa myself. <end>
<start> Morty: and how are you gonna do that? <end>
<start> summer: i don't know yet. <end>

<start> can you hear me? <end>
<start> Rick: nope, they cannot. <end>
<start> cornvelious Daniel: why not? <end>
<start> Rick: because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer. <end>
<start> cornvelious Daniel: what are you talking about? <end>

<start> gromflomite captain: one thing still perplexes me -why would Rick sanchez turn himself in? <end>
<start> cornvelious daniel/rick: well, i'm just a dumb-ass bug, but it's possible Rick knew he'd be interrogated at this facility, where we not only keep our most wanted, but our most sensitive data. <end>
