Running word2vec.py, postagging.py and dataToHDF5.py : 

dataToHdf5 combines the embeddings created in word2vec.py and the one hot vector that represents the part of speech, into one compressed hd5f file called embedPlusPos.hdf5. When running datatoHDF5, it is unneccessary to run either word2vec.pt or postagging.py as they both are included in dataToHdf5.py, and will run automatically when dataTohdf5.py is run.

Run dataToHdf5:
	1. run obtaindata.py to create the files currently being read in by word2vec 
		-This will eventually be swapped to Michael's clean data file
	2.  run dataToHdf5 using the command:     python3 dataToHdf5.py
	3. Wait -- it takes a WHILE, but it prints out some pretty cool data while you wait 


After running dataToHd5f.py, embedPlusPos.h5 will contains a dictionary in the format:

{ word:  ( [emb], [pos] ) }

where [emb] and [pos] are both numpy arrays with 128 elements each.


At the end of dataToHDF5.py, there is a chunk of code that allows you to retrieve the data stored in the hdf5 file and store it as an object to use:

h5fread = h5py.File('embedPlusPos.h5', 'r')
item = h5fread['dataset1']
h5fData = item.value
print(h5fData) //or whatever you'd like to do with this object
h5fread.close()
